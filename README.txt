*  Five Dice - A bad terminal clone of Yahtzee								*
*		Created by: Austin Karn(@synthverity)								*
*																			*
*****************************************************************************

Why I made this: I made this for my own selfish practice. This is not meant
				 to be taken as a serious project of any sort(unless I change
				 my mind).

License: None as of yet. I need to do research on them and figure it out from
		 there.

Installation: After cloning the directory into wherever you want, run 'make'.

Running: After installation, there should be a binary with the name 'fiveDice'.
		 Run that on the command line.

Compliation: Compiled with GCC. Flags used: -Wall -pedantic -Werror -std=gnu99
